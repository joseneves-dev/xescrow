AWS ElasticCache Configuration
The project should contains a folder named .ebextensions, which holds the configuration files necessary for setting up AWS ElasticCache. These files are used to configure the environment when deploying to AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

Important Notes:
Include configuration files such as elasticache.config and options.config. These files define the settings required for your AWS ElasticCache instance and should be updated with the correct configurations for your specific environment.
This will automatically apply the configurations when the application is deployed.

Deployment: When deploying your application to AWS, ensure that the .ebextensions folder is included in your bundle (e.g., in the zip file), also locales folder should be included in the bundle.
